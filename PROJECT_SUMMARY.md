# College Placement Portal - React Frontend

## Project Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive React TypeScript frontend for the college placement management system. This modern web application provides interfaces for both students and administrators to manage the placement process efficiently.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🔐 Authentication System
- JWT token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- Secure login/register with form validation
- Role-based access control (Student/Admin)
- Protected routes with authentication checks
- Password reset functionality (frontend ready)

### 👨‍🎓 Student Features
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive overview with statistics, recent applications, and quick actions
- **Company Listings**: Browse job opportunities with advanced search and filtering
- **Application Management**: Apply to companies and track application status in real-time
- **Profile Management**: Complete student profile with academic details and resume upload

### 👨‍💼 Admin Features
- **Admin Dashboard**: System overview with placement statistics
- **Student Management**: View and manage student records (base structure)
- **Company Management**: Add and manage company visits (base structure)
- **Application Oversight**: Review and update application statuses (base structure)

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- Responsive design built with Tailwind CSS
- Professional, clean interface using Heroicons
- Mobile-friendly navigation with collapsible menu
- Loading states and error handling throughout
- Consistent design language and component structure

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **React 18** with **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Router v6** for navigation and routing
- **React Hook Form** with **Yup** validation for forms
- **Axios** for HTTP requests with interceptors
- **React Context API** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom configuration
